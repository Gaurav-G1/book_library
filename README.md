# ðŸ“š On-Chain Book Library (Aptos Move Smart Contract)

## 1. Project Title
**On-Chain Book Library** â€” A simple Aptos Move smart contract to store and manage personal book collections directly on the blockchain.

## 2. Project Description
The **On-Chain Book Library** allows each blockchain account to maintain its own library of books.  
Users can:

To build a **decentralized, censorship-resistant, and publicly verifiable library system** where anyone can:
- Preserve their literary collections.
- Share knowledge without dependency on central authorities.
- Maintain immutable ownership records of their stored book titles.

## 4. Future Scope
- **Book Removal Functionality** â€” Allow users to delete books from their collection.
- **Multiple Libraries per Account** â€” Organize books into categories.
- **Metadata Storage** â€” Store author names, ISBN numbers, and publication dates.
- **View Functions** â€” Retrieve and display all stored book titles from an account.
- **Public Library Mode** â€” Share your collection for anyone to browse.
- **NFT Integration** â€” Represent books as NFTs for digital ownership verification.
